Tools and utilities for handling TLV data as defined in [ISO7816-4][iso7816-4].

This include BER-TLV data or SIMPLE-TLV data objects.

## Features
Currently only generating and parsing BER-TLV or SIMPLE-TLV data.

More features or functions may be added depending of needs.

There is currently no real plan for needed/required features to add.

## Improvements
Feel free to open issues for anything, including

- API changes
- remarks about code style (as i'm quite new to rust)
- feature requests
