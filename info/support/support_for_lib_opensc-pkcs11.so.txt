
Much is known to work, but not all tested so far

OpenSC: CKR_FUNCTION_NOT_SUPPORTED : as of version 0.20.0

How to interpret the following: Usually, functionality/ functions like e.g. C_Login is used by calls into opensc-plcs11.so/.dll etc.
If OpenSC doesn't support a function (CKR_FUNCTION_NOT_SUPPORTED), then there usually is no implementation in the driver either, but there are exceptions: E.g. C_Encrypt is not implemented by OpenSC, but the driver offers Encrypt/Decrypt via
libopensc's sc_card_ctl function. Look at src/constants_types.rs and import that: SC_CARDCTL_ACOS5* are the command encodings for functionality accessible from the driver directly (it's extensively used by acos5_gui).
Some of the following functions require acos5_pkcs15 to be installed and configured in opensc.conf in order to be operational.

It's not detailed here, that some support may be only partial: E.g. C_Decrypt is supported by OpenSC only referring to RSA
