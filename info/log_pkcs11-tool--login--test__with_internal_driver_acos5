the environment setup:

My Advanced Card Systems CryptoMate64 USB token (has the same chip and ATR as ACOS5-64 V2.00 smart card)  with a PKCS#15-conformant file structure, notably ODF, AODF, PuKDF, PrKDF, CDF, pin files etc. and some RSA Key pairs
in place (manually, no tool doing that known to me).
opensc.conf and opensc installation as of v0.17.0, i.e. using the card_drivers = npa, internal;  which includes the driver acos5
PC/SC Drivers/ccid version: I don't remember, but new enough to know about and support CryptoMate64
