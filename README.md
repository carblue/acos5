# acos5_64


ACS ACOS5-64/CryptoMate64 driver and SM module (shared library/DLL) for the OpenSC framework

The library will be limited to OS Windows and POSIX (excluding Mac OSX; I've neither access to nor knowledge of Mac OSX, but it should be quite easy to serve Mac OSX as well, if someone interested in will assist/test).

TODO explain a lot of details/usage/version identifiers/etc.
